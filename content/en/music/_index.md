## Piano Accompanist

I played the piano at the age of 3. I was previously the piano accompanist of [China University of Geosciences (Wuhan) Music Department](https://ensac.cug.edu.cn/Faculty/Lecturers.htm) and the Fifth Element Choir from 2018 to 2022. She often collaborated with [Morgan Huang](https://www.alfred.edu/about/summers-at-alfred/alfred-summer-arts/instructors/morgan-huang.cfm), a young musician and a Visiting Assistant Professor of Music at Alfred University.
